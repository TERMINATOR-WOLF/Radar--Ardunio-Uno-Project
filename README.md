# Radar--Ardunio-Uno-Project

Radar is a simple Ardunio uno project.

This radar works by using the ultrasonic sensor to detect objects and the servo motor to scan the surroundings. The data is visualized on a real-time graph, showcasing the range and direction of detected objects. 📊
Key Components: 
🕹️ Arduino Uno: The brain of the project.
📡 Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04): Measures distance to objects using sound waves.
⚙️ Servo Motor: Rotates the sensor for 180° scanning.
Applications of this tech:
1. Autonomous robotics 🤖
2. Obstacle detection 🚧
3. DIY security systems 🛡️
4. Detecting objects: Radar can detect objects like aircraft ✈️, ships 🛳️ , spacecraft 🚁, cars 🚗 , birds 🐦‍⬛ , insects 🐞 , and rain 🌦️ . 
5. Tracking objects: Radar can track the location and movement of objects 🛬 . 
6. Measuring distance: Radar can calculate the distance to an object by measuring how long it takes for a radio signal to be transmitted, hit the target, and return to the radar. 
7. Measuring velocity: Radar can calculate the velocity of an object by tracking the phase and amplitude of the radio signal. 
8. Measuring other characteristics: Radar can sometimes determine the size and shape of objects.

Here is the list of components I used to build this project:

1. Servo Motor.
